# to a potentially multi-dimensional set of euclydian coordinates with
# associated single-dimensional response values referred to as 'y'.
# 
# The "fit" function is given both 'x' and associated 'y' and creates
# any necessary (or available) model for predicting 'y' at new 'x'.
# 
# The "predict" function predicts 'y' at potentially novel 'x' values.
# 
# Subclasses are expected to implement _fit and _predict methods which
# take 2D numpy arrays of points as input.
