A agglomerative ball-tree construction method

 ****Construction****

  Declare node size $k$.

  New data point $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$. 

  Add point $x$ to the node that is closest.

  If the current layer is not full ($< k$ points), add new point.

  If the current layer is full of nodes, then:
    Measure distance to all nodes.
    Add $x$ to nearest node.
    Balance 
  

  When a node has $k+1$ points, initialize a new node as the furthest point from the node and assign existing points to each node based on distance. -- $\mathcal{O}(k d)$.

  When a node has $\leq k$ points, add the new point to the node and update the radius of the node (by measuring the distance from the new point to the center). -- $\mathcal{O}(k d)$.

  Repeat searching through entire structure until only a lowest-level set of nodes is found (always remove nodes whose minimum distance is greater or equal to the smallest maximum distance). $\mathcal{O}\bigl(k^{\lfloor \log_{k}(n)\rfloor}d\bigr)$.


 ****Searching****

  Data point $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$. 

  Find nearest node
