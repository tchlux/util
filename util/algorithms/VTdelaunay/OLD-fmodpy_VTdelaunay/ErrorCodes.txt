Code:	Meaning:

00	SUCCESSFUL INTERPOLATION OF P

01	POINT (P) REQUESTED WAS OUTSIDE THE CONVEX HULL OF
	THE POINTSET (PTS). THE PROJECTION OF P ONTO THE
	CONVEX HULL OF PTS WAS RETURNED INSTEAD. THE
	2-NORM OF THE RESIDUAL VECTOR FROM THE PROJECTION:
	||P - P_proj||_2 HAS BEEN STORED IN THE OPTIONAL
	OUTPUT ARGUMENT (RNORM_OPT).

02	!!! WARNING !!!
	(RNORM) > 10% OF THE DIAMETER OF (PTS). DO NOT USE
	RETURNED VALUES FOR THE PURPOSE OF INTERPOLATION/
	EXTRAPOLATION!!!
	--- POINT (P) REQUESTED WAS OUTSIDE THE CONVEX HULL
	OF THE POINTSET (PTS). THE PROJECTION OF P ONTO THE
	CONVEX HULL OF PTS WAS RETURNED INSTEAD. THE
	2-NORM OF THE RESIDUAL VECTOR FROM THE PROJECTION:
	||P - P_proj||_2 HAS BEEN STORED IN THE OPTIONAL
	OUTPUT ARGUMENT (RNORM_OPT).

03	P IS OUTSIDE THE CONVEX HULL, BUT
	EXTRAP_OPT = .FALSE. NO FURTHER ACTION TAKEN,
	GARBAGE VALUES CONTAINED IN (SIMP) AND (WEIGHTS). 

10	ILLEGAL INPUT. POSSIBILITIES:
		(D) OR (N) < 1,
		(EPS_OPT) <= 0, 
		(BUDGET_OPT) < 1

11	TOO FEW POINTS! (N < D+1). TRIANGULATION DOES NOT
	EXIST FOR (PTS) IN DIMENSION (D).

12	ALL POINTS IN (PTS) LIE IN THE SAME AFFINE SUBSPACE
	OF (R^D) UP TO THE WORKING PRECISION (EPS). NO LEGAL
	TRIANGULATION EXISTS. CONSIDER TRANSFORMING DATA.
	
13	2 OR MORE POINTS IN (PTS) ARE TOO CLOSE IN (R^D).
	(||PTS(:,i) - PTS(:,j)||_2 < EPS). 

20	EXECUTION WAS TERMINATED BECAUSE THE TOTAL NUMBER
	OF ITERATIONS (K) EXCEEDED THE BUDGET (DEFAULT
	VALUE: BUDGET_OPT=1000). THE MOST PROBABLE CAUSE
	IS THAT THE VALUE PROVIDED FOR (EPS_OPT) IS TOO
	SMALL WITH RESPECT TO THE PROBLEM SIZE/SCALE.
	*** DEFAULT VALUE FOR (EPS_OPT):
	(EPS = DIAMETER(PTS)*SQRT(EPSILON(DOUBLE)).

21	A VALUE THAT WAS DEEMED APPROPRIATE UP TO WORKING
	PRECISION HAS CAUSED A SINGULARITY! INCREASE THE
	VALUE OF EPS_TOL.

30	A MEMORY ALLOCATION ERROR OCCURRED WHEN ATTEMPTING
	TO PROJECT P ONTO THE CONVEX HULL (ONLY APPLICABLE
	DURING EXTRAPOLATION). AN ADDITIONAL NxD WORK ARRAY
	IS REQUIRED FOR THIS OPERATION. IF MEMORY IS
	LIMITED, CONSIDER TURNING OFF EXTRAPOLATION USING
	(EXTRAP_OPT = .FALSE.).

31	A MEMORY DEALLOCATION ERROR OCCURRED AFTER
	PROJECTING P ONTO THE CONVEX HULL, WHILE FREEING
	WORK ARRAYS.

32	THE SUBROUTINE WNNLS FROM ACM TOMS ALGORITHM 587
	FAILED TO CONVERGE. PROJECTION ONTO THE CONVEX
	HULL FAILED.

40	A MEMORY DEALLOCATION ERROR OCCURRED.

41	A MEMORY ALLOCATION ERROR OCCURRED DURING STANDARD
	COMPUTATION.

80	LAPACK HAS REPORTED AN ILLEGAL INPUT VALUE.

81	FAILED TO FIND 2 POINTS WITHIN A DISTANCE OF P
	MEASURABLE ON THIS MACHINE: (NO INDEX i SUCH THAT
	||PTS(:,i) - P(:)||_2 < HUGE(DOUBLE) OR NO j SUCH
	THAT ||PTS(:,i) - PTS(:,j)||_2 < HUGE(DOUBLE) )

90	WHEN COMPUTING SVD TO TEST FOR RANK DEFICIENCY,
	LAPACK SUBROUTINES FOR COMPUTING SVD FAILED TO
	CONVERT A GENERAL MATRIX INTO BIDIAGONAL FORM.
	EXTREMELY RARE!!! TRY RUNNING AGAIN.
