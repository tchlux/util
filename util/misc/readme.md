The [island of misfit toys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gr6GbKciNCY). One day these functions will find a deserving home, until now they wait here.

##### [`util.misc.multi_dim_analysis.make_test_data`](https://github.com/tchlux/util/blob/master/util/misc/multi_dim_analysis.py#L152)

Function for generating a multi-dimensional analysis test data set for analyzing the performance of continuous valued `R^d -> R` function approximation algorithms over varying values of `d` and varying ratios of training and testing data. This is `O(d!)` in complexity, so be weary of using more than 10 dimensional data. The testing is very thorough and should give useful insight into the relative performance of approximation techniques on given data.

##### [`util.misc.multi_dim_analysis.MDA_Iterator`](https://github.com/tchlux/util/blob/master/util/misc/multi_dim_analysis.py#L25)

This class is designed to iterate over training and testing data constructed by `make_test_data`. At each iteration it yields:
  - `train` - Path to training data file.
  - `test`  - Path to testing data file.
  - `dim`   - The input dimension of the problem.
  - `names` - The names of the columns in the input file.
  - `num`   - The numeric identifier of the test file.

Function "make_test_data" splits a given data set into components that allow for detailed analysis of model performance with increasing dimension and amounts of training data.
Class "MDA_Iterator" simplifies the process of iterating through test cases generated by the function "make_test_data".
